i want the architecture and the way this codebase is setup to be spliced even nicer, i notice that main is going to start having a lot of additional files. these shoudl be split up. example logger should be in its own folder, ai should be in its own folder with the features split up more

beyond that i just want this codebase to have beautiful architecture design which is scaleable and modular. it should be very very easy to build on top of this codebase 

return to me a PRD we can follow to enhance the codebase structure before we continue updates
